Q2. Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.

SOlution :
in css (cascading sheet style) both Absolute and Relative positioning are used to control the placement
of elements on the webpage. but they do so in different ways.

Differences:
I. Relative Positioning :
   1. When we set a css property to an element as 
   .element{
    position:relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 30px;
   }
   it will remain to it's original position, But with this property we can move to that element from 
   its original normal position to top, left, bottom or right using top property.

   2. If we changed the position of an element having a position as relative then it will not change or 
   affect the layout of the other elements. only that particular element will change its position.
   relative to it's own position.

   3. And it's space will remain empty other element's won't occupy it's space, position after changing its position 
   after the movement of the element.

II. Absolute Positioning
   1. When we set an element to have an absolute position. it will get positioned relative to it's parent element.
   2. It will break the normal flow of the webpage to position the element on the page. Meaning that
    when an element get the css property 
    {
        position: absolute
    }
    it will get the position relative to its parent element. and it's original position will get to 
    the other element.
    3. this css property will not leave any blank space on the page.
