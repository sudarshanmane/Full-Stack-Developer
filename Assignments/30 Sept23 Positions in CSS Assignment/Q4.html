          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
          object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water
          world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface
          water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean,
          covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust
          is land, most of which is located in the form of continental
          landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of
          Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large
          sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's
          groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's
          crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to
          produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a
          liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting
          most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

          Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface
          conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry.
          It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is
          widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of
          the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together
          with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon
          dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water
          and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's
          light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature
          of 14.76 °C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure.
          Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic
          regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than
          the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a
          global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of
          weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as
          nitrogen to cycle.

          Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about
          40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four
          rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about
          eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year
          (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around
          its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56
          minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the
          perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons.
          Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which
          orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a
          quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces
          Earth with the same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis,
          and gradually slows its rotation.

          Historically, earth has been written in lowercase. From early Middle
          English, its definite sense as "the globe" was expressed as the earth.
          By the era of Early Modern English, capitalization of nouns began to
          prevail, and the earth was also written the Earth, particularly when
          referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name
          is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the
          other planets, though earth and forms with the remain common.[24]
          House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form
          as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant.
          Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (for
          example, "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when
          preceded by the (for example, "the atmosphere of the earth"). It
          almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as
          "what on earth are you doing?"[26]
