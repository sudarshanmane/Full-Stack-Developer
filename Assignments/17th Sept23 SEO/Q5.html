A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small icon associated with a website
 or web page. It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar or next to 
 the page's name in bookmarks. Favicon images are usually square and are commonly 
 in the ICO (Windows Icon) format, though other formats such as PNG are also
  supported.

example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

    <title>Example Website - Your Descriptive Title</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Concise and informative description of your website.">

</head>
</body>
</html>
