SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a set of practices and strategies aimed 
at improving a website's visibility on search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo.
 The goal of SEO is to increase the chances of a website ranking higher in the 
 search engine results pages (SERPs) when users search for relevant queries.

Increased Visibility and Traffic:
SEO helps improve a website's visibility on search engines. Websites that appear on 
the first page of search results are more likely to receive clicks and visits.

Credibility and Trust:
Websites that rank higher in search results are often perceived as more credible 
and trustworthy by users. SEO can contribute to building a positive online
reputation.

Better User Experience:
SEO involves optimizing not only for search engines but also for users. 
By improving website structure, content, and navigation, SEO enhances the overall 
user experience.

Targeted Traffic:
SEO allows businesses to target specific keywords related to their products or 
services. This means that the traffic generated through search engines is more 
likely to be relevant and interested in what the website offers.
