Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable
 names in JavaScript. Provide an example where using a clear identifier
 improves code readability.

Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is crucial in JavaScript for several reasons:

1. Code Readability:
 Descriptive variable names make your code more readable and understandable. 
 When someone, including yourself, reviews the code, clear identifiers convey the
 purpose of the variables and their role in the program.

2. Maintenance: Meaningful variable names facilitate code maintenance.
 When you or others need to modify or debug the code, well-named variables make it
 easier to comprehend the logic and intent of the code, reducing the likelihood of
 introducing errors.

3. Collaboration: When working on a project with other developers, clear variable 
names enhance collaboration. It enables team members to understand each other's code
efficiently, leading to a more cohesive and productive development process.

Example:
let numberOfApples = 5;
let numberOfOranges = 3;
