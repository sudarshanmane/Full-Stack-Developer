Comments in JavaScript serve as annotations within your code to provide explanations,
 documentation, or context to yourself or other developers who might read your code.
  They are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter and don't affect the execution of the
   program. The importance of comments includes:

Single-Line Comment:
code :
let x = 10;  // Variable assignment with a comment

Multi-Line Comment:
code :
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span multiple lines.
  Use it for longer explanations or comments.
*/

let y = 20;
