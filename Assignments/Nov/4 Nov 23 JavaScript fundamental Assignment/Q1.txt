Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development?
Solution:
JavaScript is a high-level versatile programming language primarily it is known for
its use in web development. It is essential component for creating dynamic 
and interactive content on the website. JavaScript is primarily executed in the 
browser which means the code executes on the clients browser not on the web server.
JavaScript is also used for creating interactive documents, and build 
server-side rendering application with the help of runtime environment such as Node.js

Roles of the JavaScript in web development:

1. Client-Side Scripting:  JavaScript is mainly used Client side scripting, allowing
 developers to enhance the functionality and interactivity. with the JavaScript the developers 
 can dynamically update and change the content structure, and style of a webpage in 
 response to user actions.
 
2. JavaScript provides the tools to create interactive elements on the webpage, 
such as form validation, image sliders, and interactive maps. it allows developers 
to respond the user inputs in real-time without the need to reload the entire page.

3. Asynchronous programming: JavaScript Supports Asynchronous programming allowing
developers to execute code out of sequence. This is crucial task such as fetching 
data from sever without blocking the user interface. Asynchronous programmes
commonly handled using callback promises and more recently async/await syntax.

4. Compatibility: All major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge,
