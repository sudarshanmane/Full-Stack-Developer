Conditional statements in programming are used to control the flow of the program
 based on certain conditions. They allow the execution of different blocks of code
  depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.
   Conditional statements provide a way to create decision-making branches in your code.


The two main types of conditional statements in JavaScript are the if statement and
 the switch statement.

 1. if Statement:
The if statement is a fundamental conditional statement that executes a block of 
code if a specified condition is true.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
    //... code
} else {
  // ...Code
}

2. else if Statement:
The else if statement is an extension of the if statement. It allows you to specify
 additional conditions to be checked if the initial if condition is false.

 if (condition1) {
  // ... Code 
} else if (condition2) {
  // ... Code
} else {
  // ... code
}

3. switch Statement:
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
 It is often used when you have a value that you want to compare against multiple possible cases.

Syntax: 

switch (expression) {
  case value1: // Code
    break;
  case value2: // Code
    break;
  // Additional cases...
  default:
    // Code to be executed if none of the cases match
}
