Improving the accessibility of web applications is crucial to ensure
 that the people with the disabilities can access and use them easily.
 Here are some ways to improve the accessibility of the web applications.

 1. Use Semantic HTML:
     I. Utilize semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer> 
        to provide a clear document structure. The semantic tags help screen readers 
        to understand the screen content and it's hierarchy easily.
    II. Properly label form elements using <label> tag and associate them with the corresponding 
        input field using for attribute.

2. Provide the descriptive text for the image:
   Providing the alternative text for the image using the 'alt' attribute ensures that 
   sometimes some reason if the image does not load then the user can guess the image structure.

3. Implement ARIA(Accessible Rich Internet application) Roles and Attributes:
   I. Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content, 
      such as single-page applications (SPAs) and AJAX-driven interfaces.
  
  II. ARIA roles, states, and properties help define the roles and behaviors of UI components for
   assistive technologies. For example, you can use role="button", aria-haspopup="true", etc.,
    to provide additional information about the functionality of specific elements.
