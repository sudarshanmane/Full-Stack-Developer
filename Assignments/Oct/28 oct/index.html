    Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a
    system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you
    can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple contributors to work
    on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other. Version
    control systems (VCS) are essential in software development for several
    reasons: History and Traceability: Version control maintains a history of
    changes made to a project, including who made the changes, when they were
    made, and what exactly was changed. This provides a clear audit trail and
    facilitates debugging and troubleshooting. Collaboration: In a collaborative
    environment, multiple developers often work on the same project. Version
    control allows them to work independently on their own copies, and then
    merge their changes seamlessly. It prevents conflicts and helps manage
    concurrent development. Reproducibility: With version control, you can
    recreate any previous version of your software. This is crucial for
    debugging, testing, and releasing specific versions of your software.
    Branching and Merging: Version control systems support branching, which
    allows developers to create isolated work areas for new features or bug
    fixes. After development is complete, these branches can be merged back into
    the main codebase. This process is vital for managing parallel development
    efforts. Rollback and Recovery: If a mistake is made or a bug is introduced,
    version control allows you to revert to a previous state of the codebase.
    This ability to roll back changes provides a safety net and minimizes the
    impact of errors. Collaborative Code Review: Code review is an essential
    part of software development. Version control systems make it easy for team
    members to review each other's code changes, provide feedback, and ensure
    code quality. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Version
    control is often integrated with CI/CD pipelines. Changes made to the
    codebase trigger automated builds, tests, and deployments. This ensures that
    new code is continuously integrated and tested, leading to more stable and
    reliable software. Documentation: Version control systems serve as
    documentation for the evolution of a project. Developers can understand the
    history of the codebase, the rationale behind certain decisions, and the
    progression of features over time. Popular version control systems include
    Git, Mercurial, and Subversion. Among them, Git has gained widespread
    adoption in the software development community due to its speed,
    flexibility, and distributed nature.
