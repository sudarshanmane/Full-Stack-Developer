The Git workflow involves three main components: the working directory, the staging 
area (also known as the index), and the repository. Here's an overview of each:

Working Directory:
The working directory is your local file system where you have your project files.
It contains the actual files of your project, including the source code, documentation, and any other relevant files.
The working directory represents the current state of your project.

Staging Area:
The staging area is a middle ground between your working directory and the Git repository.
When you make changes to your files in the working directory, Git doesn't automatically track those changes. Instead, you need to explicitly add the changes to the staging area.
The staging area acts as a "pre-commit" space where you can review and organize your changes before committing them to the Git repository.
You use the git add command to move changes from the working directory to the staging area. For example:


Repository:
The repository is the central database where Git stores the committed snapshots of your project's history.
After staging your changes, you use the git commit command to permanently record the changes in the repository. This creates a new commit with a unique identifier (hash) and a commit message describing the changes.
